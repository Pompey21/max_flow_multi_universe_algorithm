# max_flow_multi_universe_algorithm
Here is my implementation of the Max Flow algorithm for the multi- source and sink problems! 
I've implemented the Edmond-Karp algorithm with a slight modification for handling multiple sources and sinks simultaneously, 
while preserving the Time as well as Space complexity to the linear standards!

## What is Max Flow problem?

## What is Edmond-Karp algorithm?

## Why should I care?
